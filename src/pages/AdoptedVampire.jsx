                    All too soon, he pulls his wrist away. I pick my head up, try to follow it, cling to his arm, whining my frustration. My need.
                </Typography>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    But the legends aren’t true, at least not in this. I don’t have the strength of ten men. I have the strength of one skinny twelve year old girl. He wrenches his arm free, pushes me down with the other hand, the back of my head back down onto his thighs, pins me as I thrash and hiss and struggle, clawing up at him.
                </Typography>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “I’m hungry!”

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    How dare he? How dare he lure me in here, trap me, then try to starve me? Doesn’t he understand I need it? I should leave. I should leave him and find someone who feeds me properly.
                </Typography>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    It’s not fair.

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “Shhh. Shh.” His grip is like stone, but his voice is soft, coaxing. “Shhh. C’mon, Chaz. Don’t be like this. Are we gonna have to do this every time?”
                </Typography>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    His wrist hangs above me, thick, muscular, dripping with red, with warmth, with the perfume of a thousand flowers. My mouth is alive with the taste of copper and iron, spices, honey, like a million things and like nothing else ever. Drops fall on my face. I squirm, lick my lips, strain to catch them.
                </Typography>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “C’mon Chaz. Calm down. I gave you some. You’re fine.”

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    Slowly the red mist fades from my vision. I squeeze my eyes shut, bear down, force myself to stillness. Slowly the downward pressure of his hand relaxes, and I lie quiet on the threadbare couch, head in his lap, counting seconds.
                </Typography>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “You good?” he asks. No, I am not good, I am an unholy thing, an affront to God and nature, but of course he speaks as a child of his own era, with modern words, their meaning slipped over the centuries.
                </Typography>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “I am… calm… now. I cry your pardon, Michael.”

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “Modern language, Chaz. All the time. Even when we’re alone. Don’t get sloppy.”

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “Okay, sorry, dad. Can I get up now?”
                </Typography>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    His face hangs over me, raises one eyebrow. Oh, yes, right. His blood is still dripping on my face. I reach up for his wrist, wait as he stiffens a moment, then relaxes. I pull it down to me, extend my tongue to wrap around it, lick the blood, savoring the taste until my spittle seals the wound, mends the skin smoothly, invisible, as though my fangs had never touched it.
                </Typography>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    I roll away from him, half crouch, half kneel on the floor, against his shins. Take a moment to steady myself. Remind myself to breathe in before I speak.
                </Typography>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “Sorry. I just… we’re… it’s hard. I know I should stop, I want to stop. Every time, I want to stop. But I can’t make myself do it.”
                </Typography>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “it’s okay. I’m not mad. That’s what the word ‘addiction’ means.” His voice is cool, gentle, patient. I wish I could believe he felt it. But that’s all I am to him.
                </Typography>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    A junkie.

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “Yes, I know. That’s what we are. It’s hard to be calm. And it’s harder with a permanent case of… you know… "
                </Typography>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “Teenage hormones. Yeah. There’s more in the fridge if you need it.”
                </Typography>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “Bah. Cold. Lifeless. Bland.” But I get up, walk to the kitchen, wet a paper towel to clean my face, and open the ref.. the refrig… the cold box. Blood packs. O Negative. I pour into a wine glass, place it into the micro-wave to heat, and fill another glass with red wine for Michael while I wait.
                </Typography>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    Even warm, it savors of little to the nose. I grope among the bottles, find the clear one, add a healthy dram of vodka.
                </Typography>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “Chastity.”

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “Yes?”

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “You’re twelve.”

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “I have been twelve since the War of Independence.” I hand him the glass in my left hand, checking twice. Neither of us would relish a repeat of last week’s mistake. “I do not think a small indulgence will stunt the non-existent growth of my thoroughly dead corpse.”
                </Typography>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “Chaz, that’s not my point. You need to maintain the habits of a child, act like a child, talk like a child, if this is going to work. A modern child. You can’t be pouring booze in your drinks, swearing, or talking like an old book.”
                </Typography>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “I may be out of date, but I’ve played the child for several lifetimes, father. I won’t slip up. Drink your wine.” I suit actions to words. A little bite of alcohol actually improves stored blood, though perhaps not enough to keep my hungry eyes from his wrists, his throat, the muscles of his thighs under his trousers.
                </Typography>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “Dad, not father. Father sounds far too formal for a teenager.”

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “Daddy?”
                </Typography>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    I hear a second heartbeat rhythm only a moment before Daisy appears, her inquisitive face peering between the rails of the banister. I must not have been paying attention. Michael’s halfway up the stairs in little more than a moment, his face drawn with concern, like she’s made of glass.
                </Typography>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “What’s wrong, honey? Were you throwing up again?”

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “No. I just couldn’t sleep. You were kinda loud. Hey, is Chassie drinking wine?”

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    Human blood mixed with cheap vodka, because your stepsister is a monster.

                    “Chassie’s not s’posed to drink wine. She’s only twelve.”

                    “I know, honey. It’s not wine, it’s just in a grownup glass. I’m sorry we were so loud. Let’s get you back in bed.”
                </Typography>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “Okay, can I have a glass of water first? In a grownup glass, too?”
                </Typography>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “Sure, honey.”

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    I watch as he scoops her up, and climbs the stairs. Her white nightgown peeking out from under his arm. Her tiny bald head over his shoulder. His face alive with tenderness.
                </Typography>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    I sit on the couch and drink my blood. I’m two more glasses in, alcohol buzzing in my veins, by the time Daisy is back in bed, with a wine glass full of water on her nightstand. His heartbeat comes back down the stairs. He fixes me with a hard look… my eyes must have gone full red, tipped him off to how much I’ve had.
                </Typography>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “Dammit, Chaz.”

                    “I know, I know. It has to last until next week. You’ve told me a dozen times already. I just… I needed some more. Today was…. bad.”

                <Typography className='mt-4'>

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    Another hard look. That’s all I ever seem to get from him.

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “Yes, dad. But I’m not the one you have to worry about. If we go through with this, if you sign the adoption papers -”

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    “I already did. I was going to tell you.”

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    My reflexive sigh of relief goes nowhere. I’ve forgotten to breathe again. But some of that edge of tension has drained out of me… for the next few years at least, I’m his daughter.

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    Hey, sweetie. Are you lost? Where are your parents? Is there someone I can call for you?

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    Someone to buy me blood. To shelter me from the sun. A basement to hide my coffin in.

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    You never hug ME. Not even when I’m fed, when my skin is warm and soft to touch, and my eyes are full red. I’m supposed to be your daughter, too, even if we’re just pretending, just going through the motions.

                <Typography className='mt-4'>
                    I don’t say that. I don’t say anything. How can I ask someone young enough to be my grandson to read me stories? To hold my hand when we cross the street? To tuck me in at night?
