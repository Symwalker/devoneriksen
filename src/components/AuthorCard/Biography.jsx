                    Devon Eriksen is a life-long reader, with a particular fondness for classics from the golden age of science fiction, such as A Mote in God’s Eye and Ringworld. While he was dissuaded in his childhood from being a writer, retirement from a career in engineering, and the unwavering support of his wives, presented an opportunity to pursue his childhood dream. He began writing stories with a single overarching goal: give the reader something to love.

And he hasn’t looked back since.
